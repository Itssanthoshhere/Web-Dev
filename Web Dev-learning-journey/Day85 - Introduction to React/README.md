# Why React?

- We can use states which that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page.
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components.
- React uses a virtual DOM to effcienttly update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation.
- Debugging and maintainance is easy.
