## 🔮 The Magical Sorting Hat

Imagine creating a magical sorting hat for a wizard school 🧙‍♂️. Implement a function that takes an array of student names and assigns them to one of the four houses based on the length of their names:
- **Gryffindor**: name length less than 6
- **Hufflepuff**: name length less than 8
- **Ravenclaw**: name length less than 12
- **Slytherin**: name length greater than or equal to 12

```javascript
// Function to sort students into houses
function sortStudentsIntoHouses(studentNames) {
    // Implement your sorting logic here
}
```

---

## 💥 The Double Trouble

Write a function that doubles each element in an array, but if there are consecutive duplicate elements, only double one of them 🚀.

```javascript
// Function to double elements with consecutive duplicate check
function doubleTrouble(arr) {
    // Implement your logic here
}
```

---

## 🔍 The Mirror Mirror

Create a function that mirrors a string by appending its reversed version to itself 🔄.

```javascript
// Function to mirror a string
function mirrorMirror(inputString) {
    // Implement your mirroring logic here
}
```

---

## 🔐 The Password Validator

Build a password validation function that checks if a given password meets these criteria:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Includes at least one digit 🔒

```javascript
// Function to validate passwords
function validatePassword(password) {
    // Implement your password validation logic here
}
```

---

## ➕ The Sum Selector

Create a function that sums all numbers in an array until it encounters a negative number ➕❌.

```javascript
// Function to sum numbers until a negative number is encountered
function sumSelector(numbers) {
    // Implement your summing logic here
}
```

---

## 🔠 The Vowel Counter

Develop a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string, considering both uppercase and lowercase vowels 🎤.

```javascript
// Function to count vowels in a string
function countVowels(inputString) {
    // Implement your vowel counting logic here
}
```

---

## 💾 The Local Storage Manager

For your note-taking app, implement a function named `saveNoteToLocalStorage` that takes a note object and saves it to the browser's local storage 📝.

```javascript
// Function to save a note to local storage
function saveNoteToLocalStorage(note) {
    // Implement your local storage saving logic here
}
```

---

## ⏳ Async Array Mapping

Write an asynchronous function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array of Promises where each number is multiplied by 2 after a delay of 500 milliseconds ⏱️.

```javascript
// Asynchronous function to map array with a delay
async function asyncArrayMapping(numbers) {
    // Implement your async mapping logic here
}
```

---

## 🛒 The Asynchronous Shopper

Imagine you are building an online shopping app. Write an asynchronous function called `placeOrder` that simulates placing an order and returns a promise that resolves with an order confirmation message after a random delay 📦.

```javascript
// Asynchronous function to place an order
async function placeOrder() {
    // Implement your order placing logic here
}
```

---

## ☕ The Coffee Machine

Simulate brewing coffee asynchronously in your coffee shop application. Create an async function named `brewCoffee` that takes the type of coffee and returns a promise. The promise should resolve with a message indicating that the coffee is ready after a random delay 🍵.

```javascript
// Asynchronous function to brew coffee
async function brewCoffee(coffeeType) {
    // Implement your coffee brewing logic here
}
```

---

## 🔎 The Array Filterer

Build a search feature for your e-commerce site with a function named `filterProducts`. This function takes an array of product objects and a filter criterion, returning a new array containing only the products that match the criterion 🔍.

```javascript
// Function to filter products based on a criterion
function filterProducts(products, criterion) {
    // Implement your filtering logic here
}
```

---

## 🔑 The Token Manager

For managing user authentication tokens, implement a function named `setAuthToken` that takes an authentication token and sets it in local storage with an expiration time 🔐.

```javascript
// Function to set an authentication token in local storage
function setAuthToken(token, expirationTime) {
    // Implement your token management logic here
}
```

---

## 🧮 The Shopping Cart Totalizer

Calculate the total cost of items in the shopping cart with a function named `calculateTotal`. This function takes an array of products with prices and quantities, and returns the total cost 🛍️.

```javascript
// Function to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart
function calculateTotal(products) {
    // Implement your total calculation logic here
}
```

---

## ⬆️ The Window Scroller

Develop a smooth scrolling effect for your single-page application with a function named `smoothScrollToTop` that smoothly scrolls the window to the top when called 🌟.

```javascript
// Function to smoothly scroll the window to the top
function smoothScrollToTop() {
    // Implement your smooth scrolling logic here
}
```
